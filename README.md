# RandomvsNotQuiteRandom

Demo that visualizes random points and compares them to seemingly random points that are not actually random.

The seemingly random points are not actually random becuase they have a declination to crowd together.

Idea inspired by How Not To Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking by Jordan Ellenberg.
